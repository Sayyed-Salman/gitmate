# Gitmate 🐈‍⬛

Automating the process of creating and linking local repository with remote repository.

---

## Why to use Gitmate ?

- The general process of creating and linking local to remote is very boring and repeatable, if you did it once you can do it a thousand times.
- Create a local and remote repo with a single command.
- and why not ? and it saves time.
